server {
 listen 80;

 location '/.well-known/acme-challenge' {
    root        /var/www/demo;
  }

 location / {
          if ($scheme = http) {
            return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
          }
 }

Which basically redirects all the requests to https, except for the acme-challenge (for auto renewal).
 My question: Is it alright to keep location '/.well-known/acme-challenge' always 
exposed on port 80? Or better to comment/uncomment it manually, when need to reissue 
the certificate? Are there any security issues with that?

Ans -> Acme challenge link only needed for verifying domain to this ip address
Ans -> Yes, “well-known” folder is automatically created by cPanel in order to validate your 
domain for AutoSSL purposes. AutoSSL is an added feature of cPanel/WHM which offer you free 
SSL certificate for your domains, its also known as self-signed SSL certificate. 
The folder .well-known created while the time of the domain validation process as a part 
of AutoSSL installation.
And it is not the file that needs to be removed, It does not cause any issue.
